The algorithm1 is implemented in C++ and tested on Li and Limâ€™s data set [21], which 
is  available  at  http://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top.  There  are  10  different  problem 
sizes, including 50 requests, 100 requests, 200 requests, 300 requests, 400 requests and 
500 requests, and for each instance size, six groups are tested including LC1, LC2, LR1, 
LR2, LRC1, and LRC2. Compared with the population-based metaheuristic proposed 
by Cherkesly et al. [10], we do experiments on the first four problem sizes.
